        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sift together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, salt and almond
            meal. This is important so you can remove any hard lumps that might
            be in the mixture which will ruin the shiny surface of your cookie
            later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the almond flour mixture into a food processor and pulse 8-10
            times to make the mixture finer in texture and to get it mixed
            together really well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whip your egg whites until frothy with the whisk attachment then
            slowly add in your granulated sugar while mixing on low.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue mixing until the egg whites become white and you can see
            some lines being made in the meringue. Add in your cream of tartar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whip until soft glossy peaks form. Now add in your extract and food
            coloring if you are coloring your macarons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue whipping on medium-high until the meringue is at stiff
            peaks. The meringue will feel dense and will start gathering on the
            inside of the whisk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add in 1/3 of your almond mixture and fold by taking your spatula
            and going around the edge of the bowl just under the batter, then
            cut through the center. Repeat this until you don’t see any dry
            spots.
          </li>
          <li>Add in the rest of your dry ingredients and continue folding</li>
          <li>
            Place your spatula flat on top of the batter and turn the bowl to
            knock out some of the air from the batter. You want the batter to
            fall from the spatula like a ribbon and move similar to lava.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once your batter falls from the spatula in a ribbon, try and draw a
            figure 8. If the batter doesn’t break, it’s ready. You will also
            notice the edges of the batter begin to turn glossy and the mixture
            oozes very slowly. The ribbon should dissolve back into the batter
            after about 20 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the piping bag into a cup while you pour in the batter. The
            cup helps hold up the bag so you can scoop every last drop of that
            batter into the bag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now you can pipe your macarons onto your parchment paper and bake! I
            use a #802 round piping tip and a template. Hold your tip straight
            up in the center of the circle, about 1/4″ away from the paper and
            squeeze until the batter fills the circle 3/4 of the way then lift
            straight up quickly to break the batter off.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lift your tray up about 5 inches and drop onto the table to pop any
            bubbles that are under the surface of your macaron and the batter
            should spread to the edge of the circle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let your macaron sit at room temperature until a crust forms over
            the surface. Depending on your room, it can take from 30 minutes to
            2 hours. You should be able to touch the top lightly and it doesn’t
            feel sticky.
          </li>
          <li>Add in the rest of your dry ingredients and continue folding</li>
