            Load the back of a teaspoon with a little of the chocolate spread
            and spread it in a long line from the bottom of the inside of the
            glass to the top. Put the rest of the chocolate spread into a bowl
            in the microwave or in a small saucepan over a low heat. Warm
            through for a few seconds just until runny and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the milk and chocolate ice cream into a blender. Whizz
            everything up until smooth then pour into your prepared glass.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top with a layer of the marshmallows and a spoonful of whipped
            cream. Decorate with a drizzle of the warmed chocolate spread and a
            few toasted hazelnuts. Serve immediately with a straw.
